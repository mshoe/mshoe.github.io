		<h1>Mathematical Surface Grapher</h1>
		<p>
			A program by Michael Xu
		</p>
		<p>
			I wrote a program in C++ that graphs mathematical surfaces through their parametric equation. I'm pretty sure this method is very similar to what every other mathematical renderer (Matlab, wolfram, etc.) uses, at least about using parametric equations.

			I plan to use this software for an upcoming mobile application with my team Augmented Geometry. We got second place at WearHacks Toronto with an AR version of this software in Unity, even though we didn't know a thing about computer graphics. This new version is written in a much faster language for graphics-intensive software (C++) and uses a much better algorithm. Anyways, here are some pics:
