		<h1>Little Tactics</h1>
		<p>
			A game by Michael Xu<br>
			v0.1, June 2016<br>
			1. Little Tactics is about manipulating your opponent into a bad position. It is made using C++ and OpenGL.<br>
			2. Turns alternate, with black going first. Each turn, you can move a piece and attack a piece (if there are any enemy pieces adjacent to your pieces)<br>
			3. Each player controls 6 pieces on an 8x8 board. Each piece has 2 HP (hit points), 1 ATK (attack damage), and 2 MOV (movement radius).<br>
			4. Pieces in a chain of two have 3 MOV. Pieces in a chain of three have 2 ATK and 3 MOV. Pieces in chains of length n > 3 have 2 ATK and n MOV.<br>
			5. Attacking a piece bumps it in the direction of the attack. This applies to lines of pieces as well. If the edge of the board is in the way, a piece will not be bumped.<br>
			6. After a piece is attacked, any ally pieces connected to the attacked piece (after it is possibly bumped) in a chain are also damaged.<br>
		</p>
		<p>tl;dr: your pieces gain ATK and MOV bonuses by grouping together, but damage dealt to any piece in a chain affects all pieces in the chain</p>

			Notes: This is just an image until I figure out how to get a C++ game on a webpage.<br>
			Little Tactics was my first OpenGL application. On top of being my first real application of linear algebra, I also used many concepts from computer science such as data structures and algorithms to solve some of the more tricky game mechanics. <br>
			No drawing was done, all graphics are written with code.
