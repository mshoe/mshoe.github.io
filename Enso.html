		<h1>Enso</h1>
		<p>
			A game by Michael Xu<br>
			Unity Engine<br>
			Enso is a game with two modes, story and arcade. In both modes, you control a ball with the power to manipulate other balls.<br>
			In Story mode, you must lead red balls which follow you to a certain goal, often involving puzzle solving.<br>
			In Arcade mode, you must lead red balls to a moving yellow ball. Each red ball that touches the yellow ball increases your score by 1.<br>
			The challenge is the green balls, which also follow you. If your ball or the green balls touch the yellow ball, it's game over.<br>
			Red balls spawn frequently, green balls spawn slowly.<br>

			Enso was my first game, and it won 3rd overall as well as the Creativity and Originality prize at UofT's Game Design and Development Club's Game Making Deathmatch.

		That's fine because I plan on remaking the game in C++ and OpenGL (or possibly Vulkan).</p>
